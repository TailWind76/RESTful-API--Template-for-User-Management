# RESTful API Template for User Management

This is a simple RESTful API template built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose. The API allows you to manage user data, including user registration and login.

## Getting Started

To get started with this API template, follow the steps below:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/restful-api-template.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```
   cd restful-api-template
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure MongoDB**: Before running the API, make sure you have MongoDB running locally or provide the correct MongoDB connection URL in `index.js`.

5. **Run the server**: Start the server by running the following command:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

6. **API Endpoints**: The following API endpoints are available:

   - **POST /api/user/register**: Register a new user. Use JSON body with fields `username`, `password`, and `email`.

   - **POST /api/user/login**: Log in user. Use JSON body with fields `username` and `password`.

   - **GET /api/user/:id**: Get user by ID. Replace `:id` with the user ID.

   - **DELETE /api/user/:id**: Delete user by ID. Replace `:id` with the user ID.

## Data Model

The user data model includes the following fields:

- `username`: The username of the user.
- `password`: The hashed password of the user.
- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `createdAt`: The timestamp of user creation (auto-generated).

## Security

This template uses the `bcrypt` library to securely hash passwords before saving them to the database. However, for production use, consider adding additional security measures, such as implementing token-based authentication or using a third-party authentication provider.
